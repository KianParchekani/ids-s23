Check your Python coding styles against the recommended styles: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. A good place to start if the Section on “Code Lay-out”."

Other similar services are, for example, bitbucket and GitLab. A cloud service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy.\nHere is a collection of online Git exersices that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.\nTips on using Git:\n\nUse the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub)\nMake frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.\nMake commit messages informative and meaningful.\nName your files/folders by some reasonable convention.\n\nLower cases are better than upper cases.\nNo blanks in file/folder names.\n\nKeep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.\nCreat a .gitignore file for better output from git status.\nKeep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better git diff view.\n\nTo set up GitHub (other services like Bitbucket or GitLab are similar), you need to\n\nGenerate an SSH key if you don’t have one already.\nSign up an GitHub account.\nAdd the SSH key to your GitHub account\n\nThe most frequently used Git commands are: + git clone + git pull + git status + git add + git remove + git commit + git push"
